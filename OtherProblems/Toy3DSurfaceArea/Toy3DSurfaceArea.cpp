/**
 *  Original problem statement: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/w35/challenges/3d-surface-area
 *
 *  One solution (so far) to problem:
 *  Madison, is a little girl who is fond of toys. Her friend Mason works in a toy manufacturing factory. Mason has a 2D board A
 *  of size H x W with H rows and W columns. The board is divided into cells of size 1x1 with each cell indicated by it's coordinate
 *  (i,j). The cell (i,j) has an integer A_ij written on it. To create the toy Mason stacks A_ij number of cubes of size 1x1x1 on
 *  the cell (i,j).
 *
 *  Given the description of the board showing the values of A_ij and that the price of the toy is equal to the 3d surface area
 *  find the price of the toy.
 *
 *  Example image: https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1509009918-091bdd4cba-1502631298-5cd3275ce9-img2.png
 *
 *  Input Format
 *  The first line contains two space-separated integers H and W the height and the width of the board respectively.
 *  The next H lines contains W space separated integers. The jth integer in ith line denotes.
 *
 *  Constraints
 *  1 <= H, W <= 100
 *  1 <= A_ij <= 100
 *
 *  Output Format
 *  Print the required answer, i.e the price of the toy, in one line.
 *
 *  Sample Input 0:
 *          1 1
 *          1
 *  Sample Output 0:
 *          6
 *
 *  Explanation 0: https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-assets/0/1505569910-2f8fc5da13-3d.png
 *                 The area of a 1x1x1 cube is 6.
 *
 *   Sample Input 1:
 *      3 3
 *      1 3 4
 *      2 2 3
 *      1 2 4
 *   Sample Output 1:
 *      60
 *
 *   Explanation 1: The sample input corresponds to the figure described in problem statement.
