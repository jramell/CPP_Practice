/**
 * At every step, you have only two choices: buying or selling stock. Define vector buy, where buy[i] is the maximum
 * profit up to day i by considering buying up to that day. Define vector sell, where sell[i] is the maximum profit
 * up to day i by considering selling up to that day. This is akin to defining a matrix with only buy and sell as rows.
 *
 * This way, when buying we have two choices: not buying or selling what we currently have and buying again. So,
 *          buy[i] = max(buy[i-1], sell[i-1] - profit - fee
 * When selling we also have two choices: not selling or buying the stock we're going to sell and selling it. So,
 *          sell[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1] + profit
 *
 * The implementation uses i+1 instead of i to avoid out_of_range problems.
 * Time complexity: O(n). Space complexity: O(n).
