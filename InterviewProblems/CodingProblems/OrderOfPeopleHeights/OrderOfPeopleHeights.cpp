/**
 * Contains solution to problem which original statement is at: https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/order-of-people-heights/
 *
 * You are given the following :

    A positive number N
    Heights : A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
    Infronts : A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the number of persons who are taller than P and
                standing in front of P.
    You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height

    Consider that heights will be unique

    Example--------------------

    Input :
        Heights: 5 3 2 6 1 4
        InFronts: 0 1 2 0 3 2
    Output :
        actual order is: 5 3 2 1 6 4

    So, you can see that for the person with height 5, there is no one taller than him who is in front of him, and hence
    Infronts has 0 for him.

    For person with height 3, there is 1 person ( Height : 5 ) in front of him who is taller than him.

    You can do similar inference for other people in the list.
